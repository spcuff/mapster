This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS course at Heinz College.

# About Me
I'm a second year and final semester student in Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. Before Heinz, I was working as a Fiscal Policy Analyst in the Massachusetts Senate Ways & Means committee as a post-Northeastern University undergrad transplate from Scranton, PA. While working for the Committee, I had the opportunity to combine my personal mission and academic experiences in working toward equitable and effective housing and homelessness policy, and managed to help shepherd in a few reforms for families and children at risk of housing instability and homelessness. I've folded my passion for place-based socio-economic opportunity into a skillset well positioned to effect transit oriented development policy and planning. 

Since enrolling at Heinz, I've worked for an organization helping to emeliorate the vacant land and storm water crises in Greater Pittsburgh, helped build a speaker series bringing public servants in to share their experience, and bought a grill that is my most prized possession. Outside of grad school and work, my four-year-old, K'nex-loving nephew has called me "the most fun to build monsters with" and "most good bowler" compared to my siblings. I believe that speaks best to my qualifications, in GIS and otherwise.

# What I Hope to Learn
As a former 7th grade Geography Bee Champion of Lackawanna County and a guy whose Dad built picture frames for old maps he found in bookstores, I've always enjoyed maps. For better or worse, I couldn't get the GIS skills I wanted to in undergrad, and since have relied on my grad school studies to provide the opportunity to meet my childhood and professional dreams. In that process, I studied the geospatial barriers to access of paratransit for Pittburgh's persons with disabilities and elderly residential populations. [See the link here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f7611f559d994e72863f2a3e42fa35a8). I am taking this class to learn how to better present this information, and build dashboards that could be useful for communities that lack the access and financing for more in-depth study and operations management.

We will be learning tools outisde of the ARCGis platform, which, with the proper experience and know-how, can be game changing open source software that can move policy innovation forward at the local level. By extension, my hope is that smarter, more evidenced and practical based policy will change the political equation we find ourselves in at this moment. That is a bigger question and answer than this course can provide, but I hope the skills I learn in the process will give me the tools to better effectuate change.
